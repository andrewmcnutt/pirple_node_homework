# Homework assignment #3 for the Node.js Masterclass from Pirple

### Tasks to complete the assignment

It is time to build a simple frontend for the Pizza-Delivery API you created in Homework Assignment #2. Please create a web app that allows customers to:

1. Signup on the site

2. View all the items available to order

3. Fill up a shopping cart

4. Place an order (with fake credit card credentials), and receive an email receipt

This is an open-ended assignment. You can take any direction you'd like to go with it, as long as your project includes the requirements. It can include anything else you wish as well.

### Installing

This project was built using node v10.14.1. After downloading the repo please run the code below to add the necessary subfolders. After that you will need to create a .env file that will contain the api keys for Stripe & Mailgun as well as the domain name for Mailgun.

```
npm run create-data-subfolders
```

To test the calls in Postman you can import the "NMC Homework 2" collection under the postman folder in the root directory.

```
postman/NMC Homework 2
```
