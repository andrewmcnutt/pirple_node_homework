# Homework assignment #6 for the Node.js Masterclass from Pirple

### Tasks to complete the assignment

Of all the modules we just explored, the Cluster module is likely the most important for performance. In this homework assignment, please return to your "Hello World" API from the first homework assignment, and refactor it to run across all the cores of your machine (using the cluster module).

When a request comes in, it should respond to it just as normal (only once).

### Installing

This project was built using node v10.14.1. To use the app run 'node index.js'.
